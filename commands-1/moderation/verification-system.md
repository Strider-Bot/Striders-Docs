# Verification System

## Setting Up Verification

To get started first do `$verification role <@Role>` This will be the role given after the user has verified, then we go onto setting up the Verification Channel, `$verification channel #Channel` this is where the users will get Verified from, then to enable it use `$verification enable` now all members will have to verify before accessing the server!
