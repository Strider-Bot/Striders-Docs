## Custom Triggers/Commands

{% hint style="warning" %}
Autoresponses are not custom commands, if you want things that are triggered by a prefix and a keyword, see the tag section. They offer more functionality, better editing capabilities, will _**never**_ have a limit to them and are just generally nicer for their intended purpose.
