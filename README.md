## Strider Docs and their components

Strider's docs will provide you with a comprehensive guide to setting up as well as getting fluent with Strider and all of its features and commands. The Strider Bot documentation is split into several different components, each serving a purpose to provide information on a certain dimension of this multifaceted bot. ****

**This introduction page will cover a brief description of all the sub-components as well as the suggested order in which these should be gone through.**

## Commands

The commands section gives a very detailed explanation of all the commands supported by Strider with their usage instructions as well as the parameters they support. The commands are further divided into subsections of **Moderation, General, and Settings.** Each subsection deals with different parts of Strider's functionality. There are also accompanying examples to get users more familiar with the workings of the commands.
